## 2. Research question

Using the PICO framework:

**P (Population):** <!--Describe the population of interest-->

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Protocol

We used a systematic review protocol template.[@ProtocolTemplate2025] We followed the Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 for preparing this protocol.[@Shamseer2015] We will publish this protocol in OSF.[@OSF2025]

We will include randomized controlled trials that assess <!--specific interventions-->. We will not apply language or country restrictions. We will include all papers including published, unpublished articles, abstract of conference and letter.

We will exclude <!-- specify any exclusion criteria -->. We will not exclude studies based on the observation period or publication year.

#### 3.2.2 Study participants

<!-- Describe the characteristics of the study participants -->

**Inclusion criteria:**

- <!-- List specific inclusion criteria -->

**Exclusion criteria:**

- <!-- List specific exclusion criteria -->

#### 3.2.3 Intervention

<!-- Describe the intervention in detail -->

#### 3.2.4 Control

<!-- Describe the control or comparison group -->

1. [Primary outcome 1]

   - Definition: <!-- Define how this outcome is measured -->
   - Period: <!-- Specify the time period for measurement -->

2. [Primary outcome 2]

   - Definition: <!-- Define how this outcome is measured -->
   - Period: <!-- Specify the time period for measurement -->

3. [Primary outcome 3]
   - Definition: <!-- Define how this outcome is measured -->
   - Period: <!-- Specify the time period for measurement -->

#### 3.3.2 Secondary outcomes

1. [Secondary outcome 1]

   - Definition: <!-- Define how this outcome is measured -->
   - Period: <!-- Specify the time period for measurement -->

2. [Secondary outcome 2]

   - Definition: <!-- Define how this outcome is measured -->
   - Period: <!-- Specify the time period for measurement -->

3. All adverse events
   - Definition: Definition of adverse events are set by original authors.
   - Incidence proportion of all adverse events
   - Period: during follow up period

### 3.4 Search method

#### 3.4.1 Electronic search

We will search the following databases:

1. MEDLINE (PubMed);
2. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
3. EMBASE (ProQuest Dialog);

See Appendix 1, 2, and 3 for the search strategies.

#### 3.4.2 Other resources

We will also search the following databases for ongoing or unpublished trials:

1. the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Platform Search Portal (ICTRP);
2. ClinicalTrials.gov;

See Appendix 4, 5 for the search strategies.

We will check the reference lists of studies, including international guidelines as well as the reference lists of eligible studies and articles citing eligible studies. We will ask the authors of original studies for unpublished or additional data.

### 3.5 Data collection and analysis

#### 3.5.1 Selection of the studies

Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, followed by the assessment of the eligibility based on the full texts. We will contact original authors if relevant data is missing. Disagreements between the two reviewers will be resolved by discussion, and if this fails, a third reviewer will act as an arbiter.

#### 3.5.2 Data extraction and management

Two reviewers will perform independent data extraction of the included studies using standardized data collection form. We will use a pre-checked form using 10 randomly selected studies.

The form will include the information on study design, study population, interventions and outcomes. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion, and if this fails, a third reviewer will act as an arbiter.

### 3.6 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two reviewers will evaluate the risk of bias independently using the Risk of Bias 2 tool.[@Sterne2019] Disagreements between the two reviewers will be discussed, and if this fails, a third reviewer will be acting as an arbiter, if necessary.

### 3.7 Measures of treatment effects

We will pool the relative risk ratios and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the following binary variables:
[List binary outcome variables]

We will pool the mean differences and the 95% CIs for the following continuous variables:
[List continuous outcome variables]

If several different scales have been used in the included studies, we will pool the effect estimates using standard mean differences (SMDs).

We will summarize adverse events based on the definition by the original article, but we will not perform meta-analysis.

### 3.8 Unit of analysis issues

Clustering at the level of the enrolled units in cluster-randomised studies

In dealing with cluster-RCTs, for dichotomous data, we will apply the design effect and calculate effective sample size and number of events using the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) among each unit and the average cluster size, as described in Chapter 16.3.5 of the Cochrane Handbook.[@Higgins2019] If the ICC has not been reported, we will use the ICC of a similar study as a substitute.

For continuous data, only the sample size will be reduced; means and standard deviations will remain unchanged.[@Higgins2019]

### 3.9 Dealing with missing data

For dichotomous outcomes, we will perform intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. If there is a discrepancy between the number randomized and the number analyzed, we will use the number randomized as the denominator.

For continuous outcomes, we will use the data from the available case analysis. If standard deviations are not reported, we will calculate them from p-values, confidence intervals, standard errors, or t values;[@Furukawa2006] or request the original data from the trial authors.

### 3.10 Assessment of heterogeneity

We will assess statistical heterogeneity using the Chi² test and the I² statistic. We will consider a Chi² p-value of less than 0.10 as indicating significant statistical heterogeneity. We will interpret the I² statistic as follows:

- 0% to 40%: might not be important;
- 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;
- 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;
- 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.

### 3.11 Assessment of reporting biases

If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually and by using formal tests.

### 3.12 Data synthesis

We will use a random-effects model for meta-analysis, as we expect clinical heterogeneity among the included studies. If the included studies are too heterogeneous to pool, we will not perform meta-analysis but will instead provide a narrative synthesis of the results.

### 3.13 Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We will perform the following subgroup analyses:

1. <!-- A vs. B -->
2. <!-- C vs. D -->
3. <!-- E vs. F -->

### 3.14 Sensitivity analysis

We will perform the following sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings:

1. Repeating the analysis excluding studies with high risk of bias
2. Repeating the analysis using different statistical models (fixed-effect versus random-effects)
3. Missing participants: verify the robustness of the results by seeking informative missingness odds ratios.[@Higgins2008]
4. <!-- Other sensitivity analyses as appropriate -->

### 3.15 Summary of findings table

We will create a 'Summary of findings' table using the following outcomes:

1. [Primary outcome 1]
2. [Primary outcome 2]
3. [Primary outcome 3]
4. [Secondary outcome 1]
5. [Secondary outcome 2]
6. Adverse events

We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies that contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes.[@Guyatt2011]
